Challenge: Fibonacci Sequence
Write a Python program to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.

For example, if the user enters 10 as the number of terms, the program should generate the following output:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

Your task is to write a Python program that asks the user for the number of terms and generates the Fibonacci sequence up to that number of terms.

Remember, don't worry if you don't know how to solve it immediately. Take it as an opportunity to learn and explore Python. Good luck!
