# LearningPython
Helpful stuff to learn Python with.

This is a simple way to learn Python; from Fibonaccies to Web Browsers, most things will be added at some point!
I might make a .py program for this, to organise it all.

# HOW do I navigate this?
For example, nothing.py will have the challenge called nothing.txt and the hints will be nothinghints.txt or, if it ends with H, dash-hints.txt
Use branches to see things like 'Numbers' for number related stuff.

It's pretty easy once you get it!
